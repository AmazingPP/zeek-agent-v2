2.1.0 | 2022-03-29 12:45:55 +0200

  * GH-25: Add `files_columns` table that extracts selected columns
    from on-disk files und sends them over to Zeek as a record. See
    the `README` for documentation.

  * GH-7: Extend the type system for table columns. We can now
    represent addresses, booleans, counts, intervals, ports, records,
    sets, times, and vectors end-to-end, so that they arrive as such
    at Zeek. We also update our tables to use the new types where
    appropriate.

  * GH-34: Disable communication with a Zeek instance if it's package
    version is too old.

  * Add a 2nd 'differences' mode to queries where no initial snapshot
    is provided. We now have (1) "snapshot-and-diffs", which sends an
    initial snapshot first, followed by diffs; and (2) "diffs", which
    sends an empty initial result and then just diffs.

  * Move numerical version number computation from CMake to runtime.

  * Update SQLite to 3.38.1 to give us built-in JSON support.

  * Add Broker version to agent handshake.

  * Support default values for table parameters.

  * Make exception available to table's data acquisition methods to signal failure.

  * Fix `assert` that could wrongly trigger.

  * Fix console getting stuck on queries with errors, and reduce
    unintended latency until query executes.

  * Fix CI issue on Ubuntu.

  * Fix potential deadlock in unit test.

  * Fix trace-level debug logging.

  * Fix linker issue on Linux.

  * Make --test output available on failure in BTest suite.

  * Clean up unused state in Zeek communication code.

  * Format Zeek scripts with current zeek-format.

2.0.4 | 2022-03-04 16:55:11 +0100

  * Add new log options. In the configuration file we now provide more
    control of log messages:

        [log]
        type=<stdout|system|file>
        level=<error|warn|info|debug|trace>
        path=<path for type 'file'>

    Default remains logging to stdout at level INFO.

  * Fine-tune log levels. We elevate some high-level messages to INFO
    level that can be useful to users, and we move some noisy debug
    messages to TRACE level (which is available only in debug builds).

  * Expose Broker's SSL options in configuration file. This also moves
    all Zeek options into a `[zeek]` section of the configuration
    file.

  * Link against standard version of OpenSSL by default. So far we
    hardcoded always using the static OpenSSL libraries. Now that's
    done only when with configured with ``--enable-static``, otherwise
    we use whatever CMake determines being the default.

  * Fix column type in `files_lines` table.

  * Fix enforcement of maximum idle timeout.

  * Add missing include to appease GCC 11.2.1.

  * Update toml++.

2.0.3 | 2022-02-22 13:36:47 +0100

  * Adapt to package's new default listening port.

  * Fix problem with column caching.

2.0.2 | 2022-02-21 16:36:16 +0100

  * Push all asynchronous activity to the main thread to avoid most
    inter-thread locking.

  * Fix configure's `--sanitizer` argument.

  * In `.schema` output, break out table parameters separately.

2.0.1 | 2022-02-21 15:26:44 +0100

  * Add a test build of the source code tarball to CI.

  * Extend query API to allow specifying tables that must/must not be
    present. Agents will ignore queries not meeting expectations.

  * Extract version information from Zeek's hello message.

  * Adapt to changes to options in the Zeek package.

  * Fix differential queries returning empty removed rows.

  * Fix time filtering for differential queries.

  * Fix double table deactivation.

  * Guard against an error case in Darwin system logs collector.

2.0.0 | 2022-02-14 16:14:48 +0100

  * Initial release.
