2.0.4 | 2022-03-04 16:55:11 +0100

  * Add new log options. In the configuration file we now provide more
    control of log messages:

        [log]
        type=<stdout|system|file>
        level=<error|warn|info|debug|trace>
        path=<path for type 'file'>

    Default remains logging to stdout at level INFO.

  * Fine-tune log levels. We elevate some high-level messages to INFO
    level that can be useful to users, and we move some noisy debug
    messages to TRACE level (which is available only in debug builds).

  * Expose Broker's SSL options in configuration file. This also moves
    all Zeek options into a `[zeek]` section of the configuration
    file.

  * Link against standard version of OpenSSL by default. So far we
    hardcoded always using the static OpenSSL libraries. Now that's
    done only when with configured with ``--enable-static``, otherwise
    we use whatever CMake determines being the default.

  * Fix column type in `files_lines` table.

  * Fix enforcement of maximum idle timeout.

  * Add missing include to appease GCC 11.2.1.

  * Update toml++.

2.0.3 | 2022-02-22 13:36:47 +0100

  * Adapt to package's new default listening port.

  * Fix problem with column caching.

2.0.2 | 2022-02-21 16:36:16 +0100

  * Push all asynchronous activity to the main thread to avoid most
    inter-thread locking.

  * Fix configure's `--sanitizer` argument.

  * In `.schema` output, break out table parameters separately.

2.0.1 | 2022-02-21 15:26:44 +0100

  * Add a test build of the source code tarball to CI.

  * Extend query API to allow specifying tables that must/must not be
    present. Agents will ignore queries not meeting expectations.

  * Extract version information from Zeek's hello message.

  * Adapt to changes to options in the Zeek package.

  * Fix differential queries returning empty removed rows.

  * Fix time filtering for differential queries.

  * Fix double table deactivation.

  * Guard against an error case in Darwin system logs collector.

2.0.0 | 2022-02-14 16:14:48 +0100

  * Initial release.
