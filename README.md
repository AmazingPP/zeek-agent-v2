# Zeek Agent v2

This is a prototype of a new Zeek Agent implementation that applies
some lessons learned. The goal is to come to a minimal, portable agent
that's easy to deploy and scale, and focuses on what helps Zeek the
most while keeping runtime overhead as low as possible.

For the time being, this new version remains unstable and WIP, with some
functionality still missing. It doesn't event talk to Zeek yet.

Stay tuned for updates and some documentation.
